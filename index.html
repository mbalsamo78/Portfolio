              As a philosophy, my focus in the classroom is ensuring that all of my students are engaged in a positive way. I want my
              classroom to be a place where all children can look forward to being. With that said, I do intend to follow the
              curriculum as provided by the State, which can be challenging. Determination and a willingness to learn is essential in
              my classes. School is a place where students should feel safe and welcomed, and my class is no different. My goal is to
              provide children with a unique learning experience and creating lasting memories for them to take with them for the rest
              of their lives. Students who take my classes will also learn life skills such as organization, career readiness, and how
              to be productive members of society. Ultimately, my goal is to provide young people with the tools they need to be
              successful in the real world!

                <p>Upon completing my student teaching at Dakota High School, I was approached by administration to take over a class for a teacher on maternity leave. 
                  Presently, I am teaching her U.S. History 10 course.  On a daily basis, I am responsible for executing the lesson plans I have created in advance that are complementary to the lessons she has made in the past. 
                  Using the skills I have learned in student teaching, I am instilling knowledge unto my students in units pertaining to Civil Rights, the Vietnam War, Terrorism, etc. 
                  As my major is in history, I am glad to have in-class experience teaching what I truly have a passion for. 
                  Although different from student teaching, working with slightly younger students has been something that has allowed me to expand upon my skills and continue to develop as a professional.</p>

                <p>Working under Robert Allaire at Dakota High School, I student taught three different courses: Government, American Law, and a course titled History of Motivation.
                   While teaching these courses under the supervision of my mentor teacher, I learned important skills in the classroom. 
                   All three courses are under the umbrella of Social Studies, my passion. 
                   Teaching government allowed me to introduce my students to how the bureaucracy works and how the American government is run. 
                   In American Legal, my students became experts in the law, including Constitutional Law and case law.  
                   Lastly, History of Motivation allowed me to introduce my students to practical psychology, including units involving personality structure, career skills, how to develop a professional resume, etc.</p>

                <p>As part of the curriculum at Oakland University, I was responsible for participating in an internship of observing an expert teacher for thirty total hours.
                   During this internship, I learned skills including classroom management and building relationships with students. 
                   I learned other skills that I refer to as the "nuts and bolts" of teaching - making copies, writing daily lesson plans, and being in the classroom regularly in order to establish a presence as the instructor.</p>

                <p>As my first teaching experience within a school, the skills I developed while working at Davis Junior High School stick with me to this day. 
                  The program known as AVID is an advocational program for students that are close to or may underachieve and need the extra little push in order to turn a "D" to a "C", or a "C" into a "B". 
                  While working as a tutor in the AVID program, I was able to teach students for the first time in my professional career.  
                  In addition to teaching them instructional content, AVID tutors also teach skills such as organization, timeliness, and other academic preparedness skills.</p>

        <h1 class="mb-5">Interests</h1>
        <p>My personal interests include reading, studying, and a constant pursuit of getting better at my craft. I have a
          slogan that I live my life by - I am on a constant pursuit of perfection. I feel that reading is the key to becoming a
          better learner, and as an instructor it is my responsibility to both myself and to my students to be the content
          expert in the classroom.
          I keep up to date with current events as I feel that is critical to being a positive member of society.
          I read the Detroit Free Press every single day in order to keep up with the real facts!
          As a philosophy, I feel that being a well-rounded citizen has allowed me to become a much better person.</p>
        <p class="mb-0">On a more personal note, I think that I'm just a regular guy! I like to watch sports and play some video games. 
          My favorite TV shows include Breaking Bad and Game of Thrones, and my favorite sports teams are the New England Patriots and the Pittsburgh Steelers. 
          I also like to travel.  I have been all over the country and to several parts of Europe. 
          Domestically my favorite cities are Pittsburgh and San Diego, while globally my favorite cities are Milan, Italy and Berlin, Germany.</p>

        <p>In my opinion, the two most critical aspects of teaching are Explaining and Modeling Content and providing students with Tasks, Texts, and Learning Goals. 
          This provides students with expert-level content that they can engage with, while also providing the students with a way to execute their knowledge and show me they know what the goals of the lesson are. 
          Below are two videos displaying my growth from early in student teaching to more present, advanced skills.</p>

        <p>Another skill that every good teacher needs to possess is the skill of executing Formative Assessments in the classroom. 
          In becoming proficient in doing so, I am able to determine what teacher moves I have made successfully, what moves I have made unsuccessfully, and how I need to adjust my teaching moving forward to better instruct my students.

          Being the expert in the room means that I am responsible for leading the group in the right direction and ensuring that the discussions are positive. Watch below as I execute a lesson while Leading Group Discussion.</p>
